### Executing Classifer Tree and Regression Tree ####

Regression : A5_RollNumber_Q1_Regression.py
Classifier : A5_RollNumber_Q1_Classifier.py

Both the python files are divided into cells (eah cell has a comment describing the function of the code written in it and the cell number)

*********************************************

A)Running Decision Tree classifier , Bag and Forest

1) Open A5_RollNumber_Q1_Classifier.py
2)Execute all the following cells except cell no 14,17,19.
3)While executing cell 2 it will ask for data path.Give correct data path and proceed.
4) Now execute cell 14 --> To get result for single Decision Tree classifier
	       cell 17 ---> To get result for Bag
	       cell 19 ----> To get result for Forest		

**********************************************

B) Running Regression Tree,Bag and Forest

1) Open A5_RollNumber_Q1_Regression.py
2)Execute all the following cells except cell no 11,18,20.
3)While executing cell 2 it will ask for data path.Give correct data path and proceed.
4) Now execute cell 11 --> To get result for single Decision Tree classifier
	       cell 18 ---> To get result for Bag
	       cell 20 ----> To get result for Forest
